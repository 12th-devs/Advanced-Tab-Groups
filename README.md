**Notice ⚠️**

_Until this is added as a mod in the Zen Mods store you will have to add the following booleans to about:config to be able to use this CSS_

_If you are not familiar with user chrome.css please refer to [this document](https://docs.zen-browser.app/guides/live-editing) (so sorry I forgot to mention this sooner, if you have any issues create an issue please.)_

## Highly Customizable Tab Groups
**What Does This Do?**

This theme adds CSS for the experimental Firefox tab groups to make them function and look much better.

**How Do I Enable Tab Groups?**

go to about:config and enable `browser.tabs.groups.enabled`

### What Are The Customization Options?
* Add a background to the tab groups that uses the tab group color like this:

* Add a slight border to the background to make it feel more flush in some peoples opinion _(only works with background enabled)_

* Add an arrow to the tab group that displays if the folder is open or closed

* Make the folder icon match the tab group color, allowing you to easily different different groups

(my personal favorite, with the arrow)


* Fill the folder icon with your selected tab color (or no color if that is your chosen prefrence)
