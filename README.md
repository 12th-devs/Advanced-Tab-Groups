## Setup

Advanced Tab Groups is made for [Sine](https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/Sine)! Please follow these steps to install the Mod.

1. Go to the [Sine releases](https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/Sine/releases) and download the auto-installer for your sysyem from the latest stable build of the Mod Manager.

2. Run the auto-installer as an admin and follow the instructions that are prompted.

3. Open Zen and go to `about:preferences#sineMods`.

4. Install Advanced Tab Groups from the Mod Store

> [!NOTE]
>
> 1. If you are unable to run programs as an admin on your computer, you will be unable to install, as Sine modifys your Zen directory to install [fx-autoconfig](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/fx-autoconfig) 
>
> 2. You may have to go to `about:support` and clear your startup chache if you do not see Sine in `about:preferences`

## Configuration Options  

These prefs can be configured within the Sine UI after installation:  

- **`tab.groups.add-arrow`**  
- **`tab.groups.background`**  
- **`tab.groups.borders`**  
- **`tab.groups.display-tab-range`**
