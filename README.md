**Notice ⚠️**

_Until this is added as a mod in the Zen Mods store you will have to add the following booleans to about:config to be able to use this CSS_


------------
`tab.groups.add-arrow`

`tab.groups.background`

`tab.groups.borders`

`tab.groups.theme-folders`

## Highly Customizable Tab Groups
**What Does This Do?**

This theme adds CSS for the experimental Firefox tab groups to make them function and look much better.

**How Do I Enable Tab Groups?**

go to about confing and enable `browser.tabs.groups.enabled`

### What Are The Customization Options?
* Add a background to the tab groups that uses the tab group color like this:

* Add a slight border to the background to make it feel more flush in some peoples opinion _(only works with background enabled)_

* Add an arrow to the tab group that displays if the folder is open or closed
